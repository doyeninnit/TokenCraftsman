## Project Structure

The project is organized under the umbrella folder `TokenCraftsman`, which contains three subfolders:

1. `backend` - Contains the backend canister code for token and user data management.
2. `frontend` - Houses the frontend code; serves as the asset canister for the project.
3. `createTokenAPI` - A conventional backend that includes the script and logic for creating ICRC-1/ICRC-2 tokens.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 recommended)
- DFX (version 0.15.0 recommended)
- Internet access for downloading dependencies and deploying canisters.

## Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to set up the TokenCraftsman project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

Start by cloning the TokenCraftsman repository to your local machine.
 ```sh
git clone https://github.com/doyeninnit/TokenCraftsman.git
   ```
### 2. Start the Local Internet Computer Replica

1. Navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository:
   ```sh
   cd TokenCraftsman
   ```
2. Run the following command to start a local Internet Computer replica in the background:
   ```sh
   dfx start --background
   ```

### 3. Setup the createTokenAPI

1. Change directory to the `createTokenAPI` folder:
   ```sh
   cd createTokenAPI
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Start the backend server to run the token creation script:
   ```sh
   node index
   ```

### 4. Deploy the Backend Canister

1. Change directory to the `backend` folder:
   ```sh
   cd ../backend
   ```
2. Deploy the backend canister to the local Internet Computer replica:
   ```sh
   dfx deploy
   ```
3. (Optional) Generate necessary artifacts:
   ```sh
   dfx generate
   ```

### 5. Setup the Frontend

1. Change directory to the `frontend` folder:
   ```sh
   cd ../frontend
   ```
2. Install necessary dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
3. Update the `CANISTER_ID` in the `canisterFactory.js` file to match your deployed backend canister ID.
4. Deploy the Internet Identity canister (if not already done):
   ```sh
   dfx deploy internet_identity
   ```
5. Update the `IDENTITY_PROVIDER` variable in the `page.js` file to use the deployed Internet Identity canister ID.
6. Deploy the frontend canister:
   ```sh
   dfx deploy frontend
   ```

### 6. Access the Application

After deploying the frontend canister, use the provided URL to access the application in your browser.
